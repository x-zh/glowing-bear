Machine Learning Final Project
============

Format of the final project:

1. provide a mat file containing the test label: a column vector of dimension 100,000 by 1. 

2. write a report about the algorithms you used in generating your test labels, the procedure you went through to tune the parameters. You may also list some other algorithms you have tried. 

3. submit your code, report, and mat file containing the test labels before the deadline.

4. Your final score will mainly be based on the evaluation of your test labels.
